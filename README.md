                    Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. It all happens automatically. You're meant to have fun in life. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.

                    Very easy to work these to death. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.
